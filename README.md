# Plotly_Bellybutton_Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a webpage that uses JavaScript in the HTML page for displaying UFO sightings data as a table and one that has the ability to filter the data based on multiple criteria (such as, date of sighting, city of a sighting, state of a sighting, country of a sighting, and shape of UFO) as defined by the user. 

For this project, a JavaScript (app.js) was written to builds the HTML table and fills it with data that was stored in data.js as a JavaScript array. The HTML file (index.html) was written to include all the filters for the criterias mentioned above.


## Results
The user can open the HTML file (index.html) that displays all the data in a table and filter the data based on various criteria.

For example, one could filter the data by filling the "Enter Date" field with "1/1/2010", "Enter a Country" field with "us", and "Enter a Shape" field with "sphere". This would display all the data related to sightings on 1/1/2010, in the US and that corresponding to spherical shape UFO as shown below
