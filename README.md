# Plotly_Bellybutton_Biodiversity

## Overview of Project
Several different species of bacteria colonize our bellybutton. These bateria have ability to synthesize protein that tastes like beef. In this project we analyze data from several volunteers who agreed to provide samples from their navel to identify top 10 bacterial species in human bellybutton. The analysis is important for determining the right kind of micro-organism that can provide the next best taste for synthetic beef.

## Results
The results of the analysis was deployed on a webpage using html and javascript. The interactive webpage can be found here: https://dshetty100.github.io/Plotly_Bellybutton_Biodiversity/

The display below shows the webpage where users can explore the dataset with the help of interactive charts on the webpage.
